::: {#Bio}
## Short Bio

I am a PhD student in Geosciences at Virginia Tech, specializing as a Hydrogeodesist. I am a part of Hydrologic Innovation and Remote Sensing Lab led by Dr. Susanna Werth and Earth Observation and Innovation Lab led by Dr. Manoochehr Shirzaei in Virginia Tech. I have background in Geo-information Science and Earth Observation and Geography. My interdisciplinary doctoral research leverages satellite geodesy, physics-based models, and artificial intelligence to address global challenges associated with groundwater and geohazards. My work aims to provide decision-makers with critical insights for developing sustainable groundwater management policies, which are crucial for assisting vulnerable communities in tackling water scarcity issues amid changing climatic conditions.

## What's old

1.  I presented my research work on Central Valley of California as a talk in the 2024 GRACE/GRACE-FO Science Team Meeting.

-   **Sadhasivam, N.**, Werth, S., Carlson, G., and Shirzaei, M.: Did the Record-Breaking Rains of 2023 Revive Central Valley's Deep Aquifers?, GRACE/GRACE-FO Science Team Meeting, Potsdam, Germany, 8â€“10 Oct 2024, GSTM2024-69, [https://doi.org/10.5194/gstm2024-69, 2024](https://doi.org/10.5194/gstm2024-69,%202024).

2.  I presented my research work on assessing infrasturcture vulnerability in a populated Himalayan slope as a poster presentation in the 2024 Geological Society of America meeting ([Link to abstract](https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2024AM/webprogram/Paper404507.html)).

3.  I co-presented our team project on estimating water footpint of a reservoir in the Transboundary US-Mexico Region ([link](#0)) along with another team member from 2023 NSF I-GUIDE summer school on December 4, 2024 (note: recordings will be available soon online).
