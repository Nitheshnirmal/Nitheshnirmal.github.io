::: {#Bio}
## About me

I am a PhD student in Geosciences at Virginia Tech, specializing as a Hydrogeodesist. My interdisciplinary research leverages geodetic remote sensing, physical models, and artificial intelligence to address global challenges associated with groundwater and geohazards. My work aims to provide decision-makers with critical insights for developing sustainable groundwater management policies, which are crucial for assisting vulnerable communities in tackling water scarcity issues amid changing climatic conditions.
