I am currently a member of the Hydrogeodesy group at Virginia tech. My past works focused on mostly natural hazards such as landslides, soil erosion (gully erosion), and also on groundwater. I completed my MSc in Geo-information Science and Earth Observation with a specialization in Natural Hazards and Disaster Risk Reduction from the ITC Faculty at the University of Twente in Netherlands. I also have experience in working on lava domes as a part of my research internship work at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) using radar remote sensing images.\n\n\n Virginia Tech | Graduate Research Assistant | Nov 2022 - Dec 2022\nUniversity of Twente | Education and Research Officer | Nov 2022 - Dec 2022\nGerman Aerospace Centre (DLR) | Research Intern | Dec 2021 - Feb 2022\n\n\n\nVirginia Tech | Blacksburg, VA, PhD in Geosciences | Jan 2023 - Present\nUniversity of Twente | Enschede, The Netherlands MSc in Geo-information Science and Earth Observation (Specialisation: Natural Hazards and Disaster Risk Reduction) | Aug 2020 - Aug 2022\n Bharathidasan University | India, MSc in Geography (Integrated) | July 2014 - April 2019"
